# BuilderMaster

BuilderMaster it's a library that will generate Builder code for your entities. Uses concepts such as *DataBuilder*, *Method Chaining* e *Fluent Interface*.

The original BuilderMaster was developed by [wcaquino](https://github.com/wcaquino/BuilderMaster/), this is a translation of the library into English.

## Usage

To generate the builder code for a class, add the  [jar](https://github.com/leandrobortoli/BuilderMaster/blob/master/builderMaster.jar) in the classpath of your code then invoke the following method:

```
new BuilderMaster().generateBuilderCode(YourClass.class);
```

The generated code will be printed on the console, just copy it. Create a class named *YourClassBuilder* and paste the generated code leaving only the declaration of the package.

## Example

As an example, see the entity below:
```
package br.com.leandrobortoli.entities;

public class User {

	private String name;

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
```

And now, the generated code for the entity above:
```
package br.com.leandrobortoli.entities; //Only row that was not generated by BuilderMaster

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.lang.String;
import br.com.leandrobortoli.buildermaster.User;


public class UserBuilder {
	private User element;
	private UserBuilder(){}

	public static UserBuilder anUser() {
		UserBuilder builder = new UserBuilder();
		init(builder);
		return builder;
	}

	public static void init(UserBuilder builder) {
		builder.element = new User();
		User element = builder.element;

		
		element.setName("");
	}

	public UserBuilder withName(String param) {
		element.setName(param);
		return this;
	}

	public User build() {
		return element;
	}
}
```
